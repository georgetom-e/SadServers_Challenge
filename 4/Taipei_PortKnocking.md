Description: There is a web server on port :80 protected with Port Knocking. Find the one "knock" needed (sending a SYN to a single port, not a sequence) so you can curl localhost.

Solution: Perform a scan of all open ports:

nmap -p- localhost
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-03-24 09:13 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000093s latency).
Not shown: 65532 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
6767/tcp open  bmc-perf-agent
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.28 seconds


6767 seems like the port that needs to be knocked to unlock port 80. 

knock localhost 6767

curl localhost --> WebServer responds.
